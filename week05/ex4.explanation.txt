I got execution time 4s for 1 thread, 2s for 2 and 4, 10 and 100 threads on macOS. 

In this task we encountering with mutex, to lock and unlock changing variables. And this process (locking and unlocking) takes time.
For 2,4, 10 and 100 threads we have several these procedures, so we got the same result for these tests.

Comparing with ex3, we got slower execution for 2,4,10 and 100, beacuse we are use global common variables and we nned need to wait
to lock/unlock them.
