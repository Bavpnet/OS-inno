I got execution time 4s for 1 thread, 2s for 2 and 4 threads, 1s for 10 threads and 0s for 100 threads om macOS.

These timing results are based on the multithreading processes. For the first case (4s), it will be the same time as
ususal sequential process. It is because the process is not parallelized.

For the next cases we will get a multithreading version of the process. It is because the process is parallelized. 
For 10 - 100 threads we get efficient multithreading result.
But for A LOT OF threads (I decided to test with 100000) we will get a huge execution time - 45s. In this case other processes
have to wait for the first ones to finish in the CPU. It is because the CPU has a limited number of cores.
