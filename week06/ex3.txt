In the first and second exercises we used the First Come First Service (FCFS) and The Shortest Job First (SJF) respectively.

In the third task we use another concept which is the Round Robin (RR) algorithm. 
The main difference between the FCFS and SJF is preemptivity. In this case, we can stop the process during execution and start another one,
which is impossible in previous algorithms.

Also the RR algorithm has a Time of Quantum, that means the process will be executed in the CPU just this time. After that,
it will be stopped and another prcoess from the process queue will be executed the Quantum Time.

There are a lot of advantages, but the main are:
 - all processes get a fair allocation in the CPU
 - it gives the beast performance in the average case
 - does not depend of the waiting time of the processes

The disadvantage is that the performance is dependent of the Quantum Time, and this method spends time of context switching.

RR:

        Arrival Time     Burst Time     Completion Time Turn Around Time        Waiting Time
P E|    1               |3              |4              |3                      |0
P A|    3               |16             |39             |36                     |20
P C|    3               |3              |12             |9                      |6
P B|    7               |7              |29             |22                     |15
P D|    8               |9              |33             |25                     |16
Average turn around time = 19.000000
Average waiting time = 11.400000
Number of quantum = 5

In general the response time is better, because in this algorithm we can execute long time processes without very long wait.
In other aspects, it can give less efficient results than the previous algorithms.
