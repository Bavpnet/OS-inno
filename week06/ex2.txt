In ex1.c we use First Come First Service (FCFS) non-preemptive algorithm of scheduling processes. There we sorted our input of the processes
by their arrival time. This algorithm can be easily to understand and choosing which process will be execute next is easy.

Besides, there are some disadvantages. Through put is very low and average waiting time is very high.

In ex2.c we use The Shortest Job First (SJF) non-preemptive algorithm of scheduling processes. There we sorted our input of the processes by arrival time firstly, and
if it is the same arrival time, we sorted them by their burst time.
This algorithm is better than FCFS algorithm, because it can reduce the average waiting time, due to short burst time processes will be executed first.

The main disadvantage is that if there is a long process it can have waiting state for long time, because short processes will be executed first.

Comparison of the results:

Number of processes: 5
Arrival time: 10 7 3 9 1
Burst time: 16 7 3 9 12

Average turn around time = 18.799999
Average waiting time = 11.200000

SJF:

Average turn around time = 13.000000
Average waiting time = 5.400000

In general, the average waiting time od SJF is less than FCFS waiting time.
