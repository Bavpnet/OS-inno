According to our lecture there are following types of dealing with deadlocks:
1) Recovery and detection
2) Prevention
3) Avoidance


1) Recovery and detection

This strategy does not limit the resourses access or restrict process action. 
It is reasonable to use this method when it is possible to kill a process or displace its resources.
But we can not use it in real-time systems.


2) Prevention
We can try to construct a system that the deadlock will be excluded (Hold and wait, Mutual exclusion , Circular wait)
It can be used in real-time systems.

3) Avoidance
The hardest variant because the systems must know about the deadlock before it happens. There we can use Banckers algorithm.
The best way to use it when we know about requests of proccess. And we are sure that won't change.
